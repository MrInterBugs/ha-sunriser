# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-22

Initial release.

### Added

- **Light** entities for dimmable PWM channels (`pwm#X#onoff = false`), with brightness control mapped from HA 0–255 to device 0–1000
- **Switch** entities for on/off PWM channels (`pwm#X#onoff = true`) and a **Maintenance Mode** switch
- **Sensor** entities: DS1820 temperature sensors (auto-discovered from state), plus diagnostic sensors for Uptime, Firmware Version, and Hostname
- **Config flow** — UI setup collecting host, port, and optional password
- **Options flow** — configurable poll interval (5–3600 s, default 30 s); changing the interval reloads the integration without re-adding it
- PWM channel names resolved from `pwm#X#color` via a built-in colour ID → display name mapping (e.g. `4500k` → "4500K White", `pump` → "Pump")
- Unused channels (`pwm#X#color = ""`) are skipped — no entities created
- `configuration_url` in device info — HA shows a "Visit device" link to the SunRiser web UI
- Availability tracking — all entities go unavailable when the device is unreachable and recover automatically
- `save_version` (firmware version) included in every config write as required by the device
